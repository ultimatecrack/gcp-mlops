Here are the essential terminal commands for interacting with Google Cloud Container Registry (GCR) using the `gcloud` command-line tool. These commands cover tasks such as authentication, managing repositories, pushing and pulling images, and listing images. Ensure you have the Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) installed and authenticated before using these commands.

### 1. Authentication and Configuration

1. **Authenticate Docker with GCR:**
   ```bash
   gcloud auth configure-docker
   ```
   Configures Docker to authenticate with GCR using your Google Cloud credentials.

### 2. Managing Repositories

1. **Create a new repository:**
   ```bash
   gcloud container repositories create REPOSITORY_NAME [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--location=LOCATION]
   ```
   Creates a new repository in GCR.

2. **List repositories:**
   ```bash
   gcloud container repositories list [--format=FORMAT]
   ```
   Lists all repositories in the current project.

3. **Delete a repository:**
   ```bash
   gcloud container repositories delete REPOSITORY_NAME [--quiet]
   ```
   Deletes a repository and all its images.

### 3. Working with Images

1. **Tag a local Docker image for GCR:**
   ```bash
   docker tag IMAGE[:TAG] gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY[:TAG]
   ```
   Tags a local Docker image for pushing to GCR.

2. **Push a Docker image to GCR:**
   ```bash
   docker push gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY[:TAG]
   ```
   Pushes a Docker image to GCR.

3. **Pull a Docker image from GCR:**
   ```bash
   docker pull gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY[:TAG]
   ```
   Pulls a Docker image from GCR to the local Docker environment.

4. **Delete an image from GCR:**
   ```bash
   gcloud container images delete gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY[:TAG]
   ```
   Deletes a specific image from GCR.

### 4. Listing Images

1. **List images in a repository:**
   ```bash
   gcloud container images list --repository=gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY
   ```
   Lists all images in a specific repository.

2. **List tags for an image:**
   ```bash
   gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY [--format=FORMAT]
   ```
   Lists all tags (versions) for a specific image in GCR.

### Additional Commands

1. **Configure authentication for Docker:**
   ```bash
   gcloud auth configure-docker
   ```
   Configures Docker to use `gcloud` as a credential helper.

2. **List permissions for a repository:**
   ```bash
   gcloud container images describe gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY
   ```
   Displays permissions for a specific repository.

### Notes:

- Replace `PROJECT_ID` and `REPOSITORY` with your actual Google Cloud project ID and repository name.
- Commands like `docker tag`, `docker push`, and `docker pull` are standard Docker commands used in conjunction with GCR.
- Ensure you have appropriate permissions (`roles/container.admin` or `roles/storage.admin` at least) to manage repositories and images in GCR.

These commands allow you to efficiently manage Docker images stored in Google Cloud Container Registry directly from your terminal, facilitating container image management and deployment workflows.

### Permissions


To push an image to Google Cloud Container Registry (GCR), you need appropriate permissions assigned to your Google Cloud account or service account. Typically, you would need the `Storage Object Admin` role (`roles/storage.objectAdmin`) or a more specific role that includes the necessary permissions to interact with GCR. Hereâ€™s how you can assign permissions and push an image using `gcloud` commands:

### Assigning Permissions

1. **Grant `Storage Object Admin` Role to a User or Service Account:**
   ```bash
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
       --member=user:USER_EMAIL \
       --role=roles/storage.objectAdmin
   ```
   Replace `PROJECT_ID` with your Google Cloud project ID and `USER_EMAIL` with the email address of the user or service account.

   Example:
   ```bash
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding my-project \
       --member=user:johndoe@example.com \
       --role=roles/storage.objectAdmin
   ```

2. **Verify IAM Policy Bindings:**
   ```bash
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID
   ```
   This command lists all IAM policy bindings for the specified project, showing roles assigned to users and service accounts.

   Example:
   ```bash
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy my-project
   ```

### Pushing an Image to GCR

After ensuring the appropriate permissions are assigned, you can use Docker commands to push your Docker image to GCR.

1. **Tag a local Docker image for GCR:**
   ```bash
   docker tag IMAGE[:TAG] gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY[:TAG]
   ```
   Replace `IMAGE[:TAG]` with the local Docker image and tag you want to push, and `PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY[:TAG]` with your Google Cloud project ID, GCR repository, and desired tag.

   Example:
   ```bash
   docker tag my-image:latest gcr.io/my-project/my-repository:latest
   ```

2. **Push the Docker image to GCR:**
   ```bash
   docker push gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY[:TAG]
   ```
   Replace `PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY[:TAG]` with your GCR repository and tag.

   Example:
   ```bash
   docker push gcr.io/my-project/my-repository:latest
   ```

### Notes:

- Ensure you have Docker installed and authenticated with `gcloud auth configure-docker` before pushing images.
- Replace placeholders (`PROJECT_ID`, `USER_EMAIL`, `IMAGE`, `REPOSITORY`, etc.) with your actual values.
- If you are using a service account, replace `--member=user:USER_EMAIL` with `--member=serviceAccount:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`.

By following these steps, you can assign the necessary permissions and push Docker images to Google Cloud Container Registry using `gcloud` and Docker commands effectively.
